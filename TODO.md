# Graft TODO

## Forking

* Prevent forkbombs from killing us - this was enough:
  `:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F`, as was any :F within the loop
* Figure out the "stuck wiggly" behaviour of e.g. `./graft ':F:R~+d+d:S'
  --frames=40`


## Later

* Warning when you throw away a value?
* Line and character numbers in lex/parse/eval errors
* Original code you typed in lex/parse/eval errors
* Make GIF generate with interesting first image
* Command line control of max lines etc.
* Use Generic types in lots of places including Peekable
