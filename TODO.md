# Graft TODO

## Forking

* Partly done: `./graft ':F:F:R~=r10r^:R~+d+d:S'` kind of works
* Ensure each line has a dot at the head
* Fix problem with 2:F
* Allow "None" for some strokes
* Prevent forkbombs from killing us - this was enough:
  `:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F:F`, as was any :F within the loop
* Figure out the "stuck wiggly" behaviour of e.g. i`./graft ':F:R~+d+d:S'
  --frames=40`


## Later

* Line and character numbers in lex/parse/eval errors
* Original code you typed in lex/parse/eval errors
* Make GIF generate with interesting first image
* Command line control of max lines etc.
* Use Generic types in lots of places including Peekable
