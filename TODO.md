# Graft TODO

+ Cell improvements

- Vector operations
 + Sin, Cos, Tan, ASin, ACos, ATan, ATan2, Sqrt, Square, Hypot, Pow, Exp
 - Pi
 - Gravity around the origin
 - 2d functions e.g. distance
 - Positions of other forks

- Run mypy and fix type errors
- Add type annotations

## Later

* Warning when you throw away a value?
* Line and character numbers in lex/parse/eval errors
* Original code you typed in lex/parse/eval errors
* Make GIF generate with interesting first image
* Command line control of max lines etc.
* Use Generic types in lots of places including Peekable

## To define

### Vector operations to allow orbit-like stuff

Goal: easy to do e.g. gravity

### "Stamps" - different brush shapes
### goto
### Macros
